This is a project of Live digital clock, i built it using deepseek .
i altered it's css a bit to make the time visually appealing.

features:
1. The clock displays the current time.
2. It updates every second.
3. the format is hours,minutes, and seconds.

What I learned?
1. I can get present time using new Date().
2. I can display time in double digits using padStart() and this takes 2 arguments ,first one representing the total number of digits and the second one giving a digit to fill the space if the number(time) is in single digit.
3. setInterval() also takes 2 arguments, the first one being the function to be called and second one is the time after which it has to be called again and it is generally in milliseconds.

This is my first project of 100DaysOfCode and I solved a problem of poor readability of clock by altering the css.
